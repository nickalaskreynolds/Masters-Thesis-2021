# Nickalas Reynolds Tran Masters Thesis 2021
This directory holds my masters thesis at the University of Oklahoma. This is also known as the general exam at the university. This took place during the spring of 2021 under the direction of Dr John Tobin and Dr Nate Kaib.

This repository is just for archiving purposes as the thesis was complete and submitted already. Work on the PhD dissertation is well underway and expected to complete in the late spring of 2023, building off of this work.

If any of this work interest you, please reach out to me on my website [nickreynolds.xyz](https://nickreynolds.xyz) or email [email@nickreynolds.xyz](mailto:email@nickreynolds.xyz).
